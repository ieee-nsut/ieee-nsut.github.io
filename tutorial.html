                    <h5>Abstract :</h5>
                    <p>The advancement of LED from signal to power level made a dramatic change in the lighting industry. LED lighting is now a light of this century. The presentation covers the challenges faced by power designers in designing highly efficient solid-state light technology. A small change in voltage for LED creates a large change in current. The control technique behind this device either constant voltage or constant current is now well set. It also covers the next level of advancement of smart lighting features and internet of things (IoT) application. Low ignition time, easy to control and different colour generation capability are fundamentally in favour of this technology. This talk ends with examples how the advancement of the low-cost general-purpose microcontroller (GPU) and wireless technology like SubGHz, BLE, LoRA, WiFi, etc. made the LED lighting technology smart and ideal candidate for IoT application. The smart light has now become today’s need. This helped in the energy efficiency goal as well as the reduction of lighting load to the grid.
                    </p>
                    <p>The electric vehicle is now taking momentum due to ease of engine as a motor with high efficiency. The advancement of battery technology as a energy storage elements with lower electric power supply price relative to conventional fuel. Another advantage is lower carbon footprint for environmental benefits. In order to control the motor with battery as a power input with reliable operation for electric vehicle needs like torque versus speed requirement as per need. The new improved microcontroller now able to do such functionality like field oriented control (FOC) as well as MTPA and other features. This tutorial discusses it for electric vehicle inverter design using MCU.
